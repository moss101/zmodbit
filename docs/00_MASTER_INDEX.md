# Modbit — AI-Agent Build Dossier V3.1

> **Authority date:** 2026-09-03  
> **Purpose:** complete native Modbit implementation specification optimized for AI coding agents.  
> **Supersedes for build execution:** prior provenance-heavy dossier editions and the V3 two-part numbering. Research packages remain evidence only, not instructions to imitate another product.

## What changed in V3.1 (structure only, no requirement changes)

1. All specification files live in `docs/`; the governing files `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `SKILLS.md`, `MANIFEST.md` and `graph/` live at the repository root.
2. Every file has a unique number. The V3 edition reused 17–29 for two different sets of files; that ambiguity is gone. A full old→new map is recorded in `../MANIFEST.md`.
3. The V3 files numbered 28 (existing-code donor/reuse policy) and 29 (old-repo donor migration rules) were duplicates; the superset survives as `37_EXISTING_CODE_DONOR_AND_REUSE_POLICY.md`.
4. Three overlapping status ladders are reconciled in `93_STATUS_VOCABULARY_AND_LIFECYCLE.md`.
5. Leftover de-branding artifacts (doubled substrate wording, research-project shorthand in headings) were replaced with plain wording.
6. A machine-readable project graph (`../graph/project-graph.json`) now links milestones, milestone tasks, canonical subsystems, `REQ-EV-*`, `IMP-EV-*`, `QUAL-EV-*`, E2E scenarios, decisions and documents, and carries live status.

## Why this edition exists

The architecture dossier was complete enough for human architects but could cause AI build agents to pattern-match superficially: see a familiar feature name, find a partial module, make a narrow edit and declare coverage. V3 removed that ambiguity by using native Modbit terminology, **291 native requirement rows**, canonical ownership, feature-depth contracts, mandatory existing-code audits, granular tasks and qualification tests, real-effect proof, and agent handoff/parallel-work/manifest protocols.

## Read order for every agent

`../AGENTS.md` → `01_START_HERE_FOR_BUILD_AGENTS.md` → `02_AUTHORITY_AND_DECISIONS.md` → `11_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` → `12_REPOSITORY_AND_MODULE_LAYOUT.md` → the subsystem file for the task → linked `REQ-EV-*` rows → `48_FEATURE_DEPTH_CONTRACTS.md` → linked `IMP-EV-*` / `QUAL-EV-*` / E2E → `98_BUILD_MANIFEST.md` and the project graph.

Do **not** preload the whole dossier. `89_BUILD_AGENT_CONTEXT_LOADING_POLICY.md` governs what to load.

## Non-negotiable completion model

`NOT_STARTED → AUDITING → IMPLEMENTING → WIRED → REAL_TESTING → E2E_PROVEN → COMPLETE`.

No other word means done. See `93_STATUS_VOCABULARY_AND_LIFECYCLE.md` for how this maps to feature depth.
