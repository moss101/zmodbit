## Product thesis

Modbit is an **agent-first engineering workspace** for users who want software work completed, verified and reviewable without living inside an IDE. It combines cowork-style task delegation with coding-specific workspace, Git, terminal, browser, test, context and evidence capabilities.

## Primary users

1. **Individual developer / technical founder** — delegates coding, debugging, repository analysis and browser-backed engineering work.
2. **Engineering lead** — supervises multiple concurrent tasks and reviews diffs/evidence rather than watching token streams.
3. **Platform / enterprise team** — needs policy, isolated execution, auditability, permissions, secrets and remote continuation.

## Goals

- Take a natural-language engineering task from request to verified code/artifact.
- Let one user supervise multiple agents with minimal interruption.
- Make every important result inspectable: code, commands, tests, browser actions, external effects and provenance.
- Resume accurately after renderer/Core/network/process interruption.
- Operate locally when possible; use cloud MicroVM execution when isolation, continuity or remote execution is required.
- Achieve retrieval/context efficiency competitive with best hybrid search while adding software-structure signals.

## Non-goals

- General-purpose IDE replacement.
- Pixel-only computer-use product.
- Unrestricted autonomous execution without policy or receipts.
- Separate local and cloud agent implementations.
- Model-training platform.
- A marketplace-driven architecture in P0.

## Core screens

### 1. Home / Fleet
attention-first supervision, implemented as Modbit-native states:
- **Needs Attention**: approval, blocked credential, ambiguity, protected effect, conflict.
- **Ready for Review**: completed work with evidence and unresolved review decisions.
- **Running**: active turns/subagents.
- **Waiting**: waiting on external process, model quota, user-specified condition or queue capacity.
- **Completed**: accepted/merged/exported.
- **Failed**: terminal task failure after retry/recovery policy.

Cards show task goal, workspace, execution location, duration, active agent count, latest evidence, risk/effect indicator and next required action. Do not interrupt the user for routine progress.

### 2. New Task
Required inputs: goal, workspace/repository or general Work space. Optional advanced controls: branch/base revision, model policy, execution mode (`local_trusted` / `cloud_isolated`), permission profile, browser access, skill pack.

Submission creates a durable Session + Task before model invocation, so a crash after clicking Run is recoverable.

### 3. Task workspace
Three-column responsive layout:
- **Conversation / steering**: user goal, agent messages, questions, steer/pause/stop.
- **Work timeline**: RunSteps, subagents, tool activity, checkpoints, context provenance.
- **Live surface**: switches between Diff/Code Review, Terminal, Browser, Artifact and Evidence.

No editor chrome, explorer tree, extension host, debugger panels or IDE settings.

### 4. Trusted Code Review Surface
Read-only by default and bound to `{workspace_revision, file_revision}`. It supports syntax highlighting, symbol outline, line anchors, changed-line gutter, side-by-side/unified diff, diagnostics, test links and evidence references. Stale CodeReferences are visibly invalidated after revision changes.

### 5. Browser surface
The exact session controlled by the agent is shown. User can dock, expand, pop out, request screenshot, or take control. Takeover transfers the control lease; the agent observes but cannot inject input until lease is returned.

### 6. Review
Contains:
- goal/result summary;
- changed files and risk classification;
- tests/verification actually executed;
- unresolved diagnostics;
- external effects and approvals;
- evidence chain;
- merge/apply/export actions.

A green “done” state is impossible without the configured verification gate passing.

## User journeys

### Coding task
`Create task → acquire workspace snapshot/worktree → retrieve context → model turn → tool/procedural execution → edits → tests/diagnostics → repair loop if needed → review evidence → merge/apply`.

### Browser-backed engineering task
`Create task → browser capability grant → same live browser session opens → semantic actions → targeted visual fallback only when required → evidence capture → result/review`.

### Remote continuation
`Local task → user chooses Continue in Cloud → create checkpoint + handoff bundle → capability negotiation → cloud Core worker + isolated sandbox → event stream back to desktop → review/merge`.

### Restart/resume
`App/Core restart → load Session/Event Store → restore protocol state → verify checkpoint epoch → reconnect terminal/browser/sandbox if alive or rehydrate from checkpoint → continue at exact control state`.

## Accessibility

Keyboard navigation for all fleet/review/approval actions; semantic labels on agent/tool states; no color-only status; diff and terminal views expose text alternatives; browser takeover state announced; reduced motion respected.

## Product acceptance

The product is usable when a new user can clone/open a real repository, delegate a nontrivial change, observe real tool execution, survive restart, review a real diff and verification evidence, and accept the result without entering an IDE.
