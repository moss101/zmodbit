## Canonical workspace

Filesystem + Git revision are authoritative. UI buffers are never canonical because Modbit has no embedded IDE/editor architecture.

`WorkspaceRevision` is a monotonic Modbit revision linked to Git HEAD, worktree identity and a content fingerprint of changed files. Every CodeReference and ContextPack binds to it.

## Workspace File Service

All model/tool writes use typed operations: read, stat, list, apply patch, atomic replace, create, delete, mkdir and move. Path normalization occurs before policy; symlink traversal is resolved and checked against allowed roots/protected paths. Writes use optimistic revision preconditions to prevent blind overwrite.

## Git strategy

- Coding task defaults to a dedicated branch + worktree.
- Read-only analysis can share immutable snapshot.
- Concurrent builders use separate worktrees.
- Merge/rebase is a typed Git operation with conflict evidence, never hidden shell magic.
- User can choose to merge, export patch/branch, open PR, or discard.

No task writes directly to the user's active worktree unless the explicit permission profile allows it.

## Headless diagnostics

Modbit launches language servers independently of any IDE. `diagnostics` crate manages server discovery/configuration, document sync from canonical files, health, timeout and normalized errors/warnings/symbols. Unsupported languages still get syntax/compile/test evidence.

## Trusted Code Surface

Renderer requests immutable file/diff payloads from Core:

```text
CodeViewModel {
  workspace_revision
  file_revision
  path
  content_ref
  syntax_language
  symbols[]
  diagnostics[]
  changed_ranges[]
  evidence_links[]
}
```

Display supports syntax highlighting, line anchors, symbol outline, diff, diagnostics and test/evidence links. It does not own unsaved editor buffers.

## Stale reference handling

A CodeReference carries workspace/file revision. If later edits invalidate the line/symbol mapping, UI marks it stale and asks Core for remapping; agent context must not treat old line numbers as current truth.

## Direct user edits

P0 does not build a general editor. “Open externally” uses OS/editor URI integrations where available. If a constrained inline patch action is later added, it must go through Workspace File Service with revision precondition and provenance `user_direct_edit`; it does not create a second buffer model.
