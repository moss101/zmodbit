# CI/CD, Release Engineering, and Supply Chain

> **Authority date:** 2026-09-03  
> **Product:** Modbit — clean-slate implementation dossier  
> **Completion rule:** code is not “done” until it is wired through the real runtime and passes the release-gate real-system test with evidence.  
> **No-placeholder rule:** production code paths may not contain fake implementations, TODO return values, hard-coded success, disabled security checks, or UI-only simulations of unavailable behavior.


## Branch policy

Protected `main`; short-lived PR branches; required signed CI status. Architecture-impact PRs include ADR link. Generated protocol code must match schema source.

## PR pipeline

1. formatting/lint;
2. Rust/TypeScript compile with warnings policy;
3. unit/property tests;
4. architecture dependency lint;
5. SQLite migration tests;
6. real local component integration (Git/SQLite/PTy/index);
7. protocol compatibility tests;
8. SAST/dependency/license/secret scans;
9. packaged desktop smoke against real local Core.

No live paid model call is required on every PR, but adapter changes trigger provider conformance in protected environment before merge where feasible.

## Nightly pipeline

- live OpenAI/Anthropic provider conformance;
- local agent E2E trials;
- real Chromium browser suite;
- restart/kill recovery matrix;
- retrieval/context benchmarks;
- cloud staging E2E with real MicroVM;
- security attack suite;
- performance trend collection.

## Release-candidate pipeline

Runs every required E2E scenario in `51_E2E_ACCEPTANCE_TEST_CATALOG.md` on signed candidate binaries and records evidence bundle. No skipped mandatory scenario allowed. Flaky tests are failures until root-caused; they are not silently retried to green without recording all attempts.

## Build reproducibility

- exact dependency lockfiles;
- Rust toolchain pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`;
- Node/pnpm version pinned;
- Electron builder inputs pinned;
- sandbox guest image built from declarative Docker/VM image recipe and pinned by digest;
- SBOM for desktop, services and guest image;
- artifact checksums and signatures.

## Desktop update

Signed update manifests; staged rollout; rollback to previous compatible version. Core DB migration compatibility is checked before update install. Critical schema migration takes backup/checkpoint first.

## Cloud deploy

Blue/green or canary service rollout. DB migrations are expand→migrate→contract, never destructive in same release as code dependency. Cloud workers support current and previous protocol major/minor during rollout window.

## Supply-chain policy

New dependency requires owner, license, security/maintenance check, strategic justification and exit plan. GitHub/source URL is recorded in dependency inventory. Native binary dependencies require checksum/signature and reproducible provenance.
